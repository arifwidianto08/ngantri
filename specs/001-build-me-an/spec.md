# Feature Specification: Food Court Ordering System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-me-an`  
**Created**: 2025-10-04  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build me an application to automate ordering system in a food court area"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A food court customer (buyer) sits at a table, scans a QR code to access the ordering system, browses menus from multiple merchants, adds items to their cart, provides their contact information, receives order confirmation, visits merchants to pay in person, waits for order preparation notifications via WhatsApp, and collects their completed orders.

A food court merchant (seller) registers on the platform, sets up their profile and menu with pricing and availability, receives customer orders, accepts payments in person, prepares orders, notifies customers when ready via WhatsApp or direct call, and marks orders as completed when picked up.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a buyer is seated at a food court table with a QR code, **When** they scan the QR code with their phone, **Then** they access the commerce homepage showing available merchants and menus
2. **Given** a buyer is browsing the menu, **When** they add items from multiple merchants to their cart and proceed to checkout, **Then** they are prompted to enter their name and WhatsApp number
3. **Given** a buyer has submitted their order with contact information, **When** the order is processed, **Then** merchants receive the order details and the buyer receives an order confirmation with unique order numbers
4. **Given** a buyer has confirmed orders, **When** they visit merchants using unique merchant numbers, **Then** they can complete payment in person and merchants can verify and accept the orders
5. **Given** a merchant has accepted and prepared an order, **When** they notify the customer, **Then** they can either call directly or send an automated WhatsApp message with the order ready notification
6. **Given** a buyer receives an order ready notification, **When** they collect their order from the merchant, **Then** the order status is marked as completed in the system
7. **Given** a buyer has closed the app after ordering, **When** a merchant sends them a notification, **Then** they receive a time-limited order link showing their confirmed orders

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a buyer adds items to cart but doesn't complete checkout?
- How does the system handle when a merchant marks an item as unavailable after it's been ordered?
- What occurs if a buyer doesn't show up to pay for their order within a reasonable timeframe?
- How are duplicate orders prevented if a buyer submits multiple times?
- What happens if WhatsApp notification delivery fails?
- How does the system handle expired order links?
