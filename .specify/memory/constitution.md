# Ngantri Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every code contribution MUST meet measurable quality standards before integration. Code reviews MUST enforce clean code principles: readable naming, single responsibility, minimal complexity. Static analysis tools MUST pass (linting, type checking, security scanning). Technical debt MUST be documented with tracking tickets and remediation timelines. No code merges without passing all quality gates.

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and ensures long-term project success. Quality cannot be retrofitted.

### II. Test-Driven Excellence

Test coverage MUST meet minimum thresholds: 90% unit test coverage, 80% integration test coverage. Tests MUST be written before implementation (TDD cycle: Red-Green-Refactor). All critical user journeys MUST have automated end-to-end tests. Performance regression tests MUST exist for core functionality. Test failures block all deployments.

**Rationale**: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability, prevents regressions, and enables confident refactoring and feature development.

### III. User Experience Consistency

UI components MUST follow established design system patterns and accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum). User interactions MUST be consistent across all features (navigation, feedback, error handling). Loading states, error messages, and success confirmations MUST follow standardized patterns. User testing MUST validate critical flows before release.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces user confusion, improves adoption, and maintains professional quality standards.

### IV. Performance Requirements

Response times MUST not exceed defined SLAs: API endpoints <200ms p95, page loads <3s, user interactions <100ms. Resource usage MUST stay within limits: memory growth <5% per hour, CPU usage <70% sustained. Performance monitoring MUST be implemented with alerting. Performance regressions block deployment.

**Rationale**: Performance directly impacts user satisfaction and system scalability. Performance problems compound over time if not addressed early.

## Quality Gates

All features MUST pass through mandatory quality checkpoints:

1. **Specification Review**: Requirements clarity, testability, UX consistency alignment
2. **Design Review**: Architecture soundness, performance considerations, security review
3. **Implementation Review**: Code quality standards, test coverage, documentation completeness
4. **User Acceptance**: UX validation, accessibility compliance, performance benchmarks
5. **Production Readiness**: Monitoring setup, rollback procedures, performance validation

Quality gate failures require remediation before progression to next phase.

## Development Standards

**Code Organization**: Follow established project structure patterns. Maintain clear separation of concerns. Document architectural decisions in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records).

**Security**: Security considerations MUST be addressed in every feature. Sensitive data MUST be properly secured. Security reviews required for authentication, authorization, and data handling features.

**Documentation**: Code MUST include clear comments for complex logic. API changes MUST update documentation. User-facing features MUST include usage documentation.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards. All team members MUST comply with these principles. Violations require immediate remediation.

**Amendment Process**: Constitution changes require team consensus and impact assessment. Major changes (new principles, removed requirements) increment major version. Minor changes (clarifications, additions) increment minor version.

**Compliance Monitoring**: Regular audits verify adherence to constitutional principles. Quality metrics dashboards track compliance trends. Non-compliance triggers improvement plans.
